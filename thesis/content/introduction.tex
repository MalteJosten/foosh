The introduction is a short overview of the context and goals of the paper.
It describes the structure and contents of the paper
to provide the reader with enough information
to find parts of relevance to their current interest quickly.

If you are unfamiliar with {\LaTeX},
you will probably need to take some time to learn the general workflow.
However, this will save you a lot of time and headaches later on,
as it allows you to completely focus on the content
instead of managing layouts and correct citation.
There are multiple great guides and introductions on using it.~\cite{overleaf,learnlatex,wiki}

You can also find a searchable and browsable list of all common {\LaTeX} documentation online.~\cite{texdoc}
