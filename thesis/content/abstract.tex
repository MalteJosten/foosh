\chapter*{Abstract}

An abstract is a brief summary of a research article, thesis, review, conference proceeding,
or any in-depth analysis of a particular subject
and is often used to help the reader quickly ascertain the paper's purpose.
When used, an abstract always appears at the beginning of a manuscript or typescript,
acting as the point-of-entry for any given academic paper or patent application.
Abstracting and indexing services for various academic disciplines
are aimed at compiling a body of literature for that particular subject.
