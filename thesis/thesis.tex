% text "What I still have to do here".
% The first line activates this feature. If you comment it out and uncomment

% We recommend to split your document into several files. Usually one for every chapter is a
% good idea. If you follow this guideline (how to assemble these files in a single document
% see two paragraphs below) you will be able to single out chapters via the \includeonly{}
% command. Using this mechanism page numbering and references of the full run before will be
% preserved. This also nice, if your latex run tends to get slow and you need to fine tune
% some formatting in one chapter - just include that one. The rest (or at least the ones before
% the one currently under construction) will remain untouched. This means a boost in compilation time.
